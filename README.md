# fMRI-Data-Analysis-AFNI
This project involves the analysis of fMRI data, focusing on preprocessing, registration, and statistical analysis to explore brain activity in response to specific tasks. The preprocessing steps include skull stripping to isolate the brain from structural images and segmenting different brain tissues. Functional data is then corrected for slice timing discrepancies and head motion to ensure accurate alignment with the structural images.

Following preprocessing, the functional images are registered to the structural images to accurately overlay functional activity onto anatomical data. The project then involves constructing a general linear model (GLM) based on the experimental design, which identifies areas of the brain activated by specific stimuli. The results undergo spatial smoothing and cluster size correction to control for false positives, and significant brain activations are visualized and documented. The final output includes statistical maps that highlight the regions of the brain involved in the task, providing insights into neural processes.
